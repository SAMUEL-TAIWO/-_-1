# 🌸 Iris Classification Project

## Background 🌍
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, often used for pattern recognition and classification tasks. It contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers—*Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*. The dataset includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to classify the species of Iris flowers based on these features using various machine learning models.

## Project Goals 🎯
- **Feature Analysis**: Explore and understand the relationships between different features in the dataset.
- **Model Development**: Build and fine-tune multiple machine learning models to accurately classify Iris species.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare the performance of different models using various metrics to select the best one.
